# Creating PRs

Use this rule when creating PRs.

## Ticket criteria

Verify your list of connected mcps to determine whether a user has a ticket tracking mcp enabled. If they do, consider whether a ticket should be created for this PR.

Tickets SHOULD be created if the PR is:
  - Fixing a user facing bug (e.g., your app is deployed already and you're not prototyping)
  - Introducing a brand new feature
  - Refactoring an existing feature

Tickets should NOT be created if the PR is:
  - A small quick fix
  - A style change

If you are unsure whether a ticket should be created you should ask the user.

## Creating the PR

1. Always make sure the default branch is up-to-date before creating a PR.
2. Determine if a ticket should be created (see criteria above). If yes, create it first and link it to the PR.
3. Use `gh pr create --fill` to create a PR and fill in the details (DO NOT write your own PR description)

## Post Creation (MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP)

Immediately after `gh pr create` succeeds, you MUST invoke BOTH skills below. Use the Skill tool twice in the SAME message so they run in parallel. Do NOT run one, wait for it, then run the other. Do NOT skip either one. Do NOT respond to the user until BOTH have been invoked:

1. `/review-pr <PR number>`
2. `/production-readiness <PR number>`

If you only ran one, STOP and run the other immediately before doing anything else.

Once both complete, return the results to the user and offer to make concrete fixes for each issue.
