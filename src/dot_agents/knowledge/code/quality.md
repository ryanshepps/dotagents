# Quality

Testing strategy, debt, resilience, and code-health practices. Use when writing tests, weighing rewrites, or judging whether code can survive in production.

## Entries (by priority)

- [[kernighans-law]] (p1) — Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
- [[pareto-principle]] (p1) — 80% of the problems result from 20% of the causes.
- [[simplicity-first]] (p1) — Write the minimum code that solves the asked problem — no speculative features, abstractions, flexibility, or defensive handling.
- [[surgical-changes]] (p1) — Touch only what the request requires — don't refactor, reformat, or clean up adjacent code uninvited.
- [[technical-debt]] (p1) — Technical Debt is everything that slows us down when developing software.
- [[yagni]] (p1) — Don't add functionality until it is necessary.
- [[agent-expedient-patterns]] (p2) — Watch for god objects, positional arrays, unsafe shared mutation, and conditional sprawl — default path when adding code under time pressure.
- [[boy-scout-rule]] (p2) — Leave the code better than you found it.
- [[broken-windows-theory]] (p2) — Don't leave broken windows (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired.
- [[bus-factor]] (p2) — The minimum number of team members whose loss would put the project in serious trouble.
- [[doherty-threshold]] (p2) — Keep system response under 400ms — below that threshold, users stay in flow and productivity climbs sharply.
- [[goodharts-law]] (p2) — When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
- [[keep-test-paths-out-of-production-runtime]] (p2) — Keep test and local-only execution paths out of production runtime code; mock external systems at process or protocol boundaries instead.
- [[murphys-law]] (p2) — Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.
- [[postels-law]] (p2) — Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.
- [[resilience-patterns]] (p2) — Defensive patterns — circuit breaker, bulkhead, timeout, retry with backoff — that contain failures in distributed systems.
- [[testing-pyramid]] (p2) — A project should have many fast unit tests, fewer integration tests, and only a small number of UI tests.
- [[velocity-masks-decay]] (p2) — Fast feature shipping hides architectural rot — codebase looks healthy until many things break at once.
- [[feature-toggles]] (p3) — Runtime flags that decouple deploy from release, enabling trunk-based development, gradual rollout, and kill switches — but each flag is debt.
- [[law-of-unintended-consequences]] (p3) — Whenever you change a complex system, expect surprise.
- [[lehmans-laws]] (p3) — Software that reflects the real world must evolve, and that evolution has predictable limits.
- [[linuss-law]] (p3) — Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.
- [[pesticide-paradox]] (p3) — Repeatedly running the same tests becomes less effective over time.

## Tensions

- **Boy-scout rule** vs **surgical changes** — opportunistic cleanup improves code health, but uninvited refactors bloat diff scope. Apply boy-scout for trivial single-line fixes adjacent to your task; stay surgical when reviewers need a tight, focused diff.
