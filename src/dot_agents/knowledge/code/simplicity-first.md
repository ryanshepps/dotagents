# Simplicity First

> Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you wrote 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Test: "Would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

Karpathy-flavored KISS/YAGNI, tuned for LLM failure modes that default to speculative generality.
