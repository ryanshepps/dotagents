# Scale

Limits on parallelization, network effects, and where adding hardware stops paying. Use when optimizing throughput or sizing concurrent systems.

## Entries (by priority)

- [[resilience-patterns]] (p2) — Defensive patterns — circuit breaker, bulkhead, timeout, retry with backoff — that contain failures in distributed systems.
- [[amdahls-law]] (p3) — The speedup from parallelization is limited by the fraction of work that cannot be parallelized.
- [[gustafsons-law]] (p3) — It is possible to achieve significant speedup in parallel processing by increasing the problem size.
- [[metcalfes-law]] (p3) — The value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users.
