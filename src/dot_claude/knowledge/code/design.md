# Design

Code-level patterns for what to abstract, what to leave concrete, and when copying beats unifying. Use when shaping a module, naming the duplication threshold, or pruning premature abstractions.

## Entries (by priority)

- [[dry-principle]] (p1) — Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation.
- [[kernighans-law]] (p1) — Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
- [[kiss-principle]] (p1) — Designs and systems should be as simple as possible.
- [[simplicity-first]] (p1) — Write the minimum code that solves the asked problem — no speculative features, abstractions, flexibility, or defensive handling.
- [[solid-principles]] (p1) — Five main guidelines that enhance software design, making code more maintainable and scalable.
- [[technical-debt]] (p1) — Technical Debt is everything that slows us down when developing software.
- [[yagni]] (p1) — Don't add functionality until it is necessary.
- [[broken-windows-theory]] (p2) — Don't leave broken windows (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired.
- [[forgiving-search]] (p2) — Search must match how users describe things, not how data is stored — substring matching is not search.
- [[hexagonal-architecture]] (p2) — Isolate domain logic from I/O by defining ports (interfaces the core needs) and adapters (implementations for DB, HTTP, queues).
- [[law-of-demeter]] (p2) — An object should only interact with its immediate friends, not strangers.
- [[law-of-leaky-abstractions]] (p2) — All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.
- [[postels-law]] (p2) — Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.
- [[principle-of-least-astonishment]] (p2) — Software and interfaces should behave in a way that least surprises users and other developers.
- [[teslers-law]] (p2) — Every application has an inherent amount of irreducible complexity that can only be shifted, not eliminated.
- [[lehmans-laws]] (p3) — Software that reflects the real world must evolve, and that evolution has predictable limits.
- [[zawinskis-law]] (p3) — Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail.
